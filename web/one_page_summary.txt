GreenPrompt: One-Page Executive Summary
Problem | Solution | Market Value
For: Quick pitches, investors, judges, team | Read Time: 2 minutes


THE PROBLEM: THE INVISIBLE CRISIS
Current Reality: - 2.5 billion LLM prompts run daily (ChatGPT alone) - 750 GWh energy consumed daily (equivalent to 750,000 homes) - 650 million liters water used for cooling daily - 300,000 tons CO emitted daily - 25-40% of this is avoidable waste (research-proven)
What Developers Experience: -  Don't know their prompt's energy cost -
 No tools to estimate before running - No guidance on optimization - Make billions of ine?icient prompts daily
What Corporations Experience: - Can't track AI carbon footprint (ESG reporting gap) - Leaving $1.25-2B/year in API savings on the table - Regu- latory risk (EU AI Act, carbon mandates) - No visibility into infrastructure spend
Market Quantification: - TAM: $2-3.5B (enterprise + developer sustainabil- ity tools) - Addressable opportunity: $500M-2B in first 3 years - Wasted API spend: $1.25-2B annually (at 25-40% ine?iciency)


THE OPPORTUNITY: RESEARCH BREAKTHROUGH
Recent research (2024-2025) proves: - 20-45% energy reduction is possible without sacrificing accuracy - Response length dominates (0.9 correlation with energy) - Structured outputs save 20-45% (JSON/bullets vs prose) - Keywords matter ("classify" vs "analyze") - Model selection > prompt optimization (10-40x impact)
The Gap: Research exists but no accessible tools. This is our opportunity.


THE SOLUTION: GreenPrompt (3-in-1 Platform)
Feature 1: Prompt Analyzer (< 30 seconds)
Input: "Please analyze and explain this text in detail..." Output: Energy: 1,500 J
Suggestions:
1. Use "Analyze" (appropriate)




2. Change to bullets: -300 J
3. Remove "great": -200 J
4. Add max_tokens: -150 J

Predicted: 850 J (43% savings, 92% confidence)
Value: Makes invisible cost visible. Actionable recommendations.
Feature 2: Energy Profiler (< 2 minutes)
Input: Your prompt + [Qwen3B, Mistral7B, Gemma7B] Output: Efficiency Rankings:
Qwen2.5-3B: 300J, 91% accuracy
Mistral-7B: 520J, 94% accuracy (+3%, cost +220J) Gemma-7B: 650J, 93% accuracy

Recommendation: Use Qwen if efficiency critical; Mistral if accuracy worth it
Value: Model selection clarity. Eliminates guesswork.
Feature 3: Team Dashboard (Real-time)
Energy Saved (Month): 45.2 kWh ? 32% CO Prevented: 18.1 kg
Water Saved: 4.5M liters
API Cost Reduced: $2.26 (per-team savings)

Team Leaderboard: Gamification drives behavior ESG Reporting: Compliance-ready export
Value: Accountability + incentives. ESG-ready reporting.
